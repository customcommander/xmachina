* XMachina

This is an educational project used to explore DSL design.
I make no commitments to deliver anything useful anytime.

Ultimately my goal is to provide a concise and declarative
language for state machines and to augment the experience
of working with XState.

** TL; DR

#+begin_src javascript
import {interpret} from 'xstate';
import {xmachina} from '@customcommander/xmachina';

const service =
  interpret(xmachina`
    machine question {
      is_valid = ${(ctx, ev) => ev.answer === 42}

      initial state searching {
        ON_ANSWER => is_valid? found
      }

      final state found {}
    }`);

service.start();

service.send({type: 'ON_ANSWER', answer: 10});
// still searching

service.send({type: 'ON_ANSWER', answer: 42});
// found answer!

#+end_src
