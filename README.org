* XMachina

The goal of this project is to provide a concise yet
declarative language for state machines and to augment
the experience of working with [[https://github.com/statelyai/xstate][XState]].

At this stage this is an educational project only and
I make no commitments to deliver anything useful
at any time.

** TL; DR

#+begin_src javascript
import {interpret} from 'xstate';
import {xmachina} from '@customcommander/xmachina';

const service =
  interpret(xmachina`
    machine question {
      is_valid = ${(ctx, ev) => ev.answer === 42}

      initial state searching {
        ON_ANSWER => is_valid? found
      }

      final state found {}
    }`);

service.start();

service.send({type: 'ON_ANSWER', answer: 10});
// still searching

service.send({type: 'ON_ANSWER', answer: 42});
// found answer!

#+end_src
