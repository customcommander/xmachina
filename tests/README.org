* Testing

** Compiler

Each text file (e.g. =201.txt=) is a unique test case
with an input section and an output section.

The input section contains the definition of a machine
using XMachina. The output section is the expected
machine definition as per the XState specification.

All test cases are automatically converted into
executable tests when you run =make test=.

I suspect that the compiler will require a lot of
testing and therefore I want to minimise the effort
required to produce them so we can have as many
as we like or need.

By keeping them framework agnostic I also give myself
the opportunity to integrate with other things such
as documentation tools for example.
